This foalder contain python module (basic functions) that will help to analyze the using Time Domain Ptychography routine.

the package called "ptycho.py". The attached notebook is a tutorial of how to use the package. Another file named 

"Ptycho_COM", is an attempt to analyze the traces for differents bounces on the chirped mirrors.

Recomendation: 
  
  The COM method it may potentionly be good and fast way to get smart guess at the begining, but a mathematical proof

associated to it as a support of its validity. The following paper can help [Ultramacroscopy_Ivan_COM] 

-in the folder Ptycho_COM-.

Anouar.
