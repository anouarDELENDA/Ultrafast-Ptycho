Dear Reader, 

This foalder contain python module (basic functions) that will help to analyze and using the Time Domain Ptychography routine.

the package called "ptycho.py". The attached notebook is a tutorial of how to use the package. With the same package and as the future work of this project an attempt to use what we call the "Center of Mass" method to initiate the ptycho routine by a smart guess, the idea was used before in microscopy and we tried to bring it to spectroscopy and apply in our case. This additional features still need for further studies.

Recomendation: 
  
  The COM method it may potentionly be good and fast way to get smart guess at the begining, but a mathematical proof

associated to it is a nust as a support of its validity. The following paper can help [Ultramacroscopy_Ivan_COM] 

-in the folder Ptycho_COM-.

Anouar.
